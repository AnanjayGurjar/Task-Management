# Task-Management

Task Management is all in one task manager app, a user can create task and add people to it. It was build during the iNeuron hackathon 2.0 in association
with jetbrains. The app uses android with kotlin as frontend and for creating user and storing user data firebase is used. The functions for all the 
operations are written under MainViewModel Class. Though major functions were written but we failed to integrate the final ui together
